## Technical description  
- Project is done with **Vite** as a development environment tool. I've decided to use it instead of **Webpack** (which I had been using in my previous React based projects), even though in a small project like this I think it would make no difference in terms of speed.  
- _React + TypeScript + SCSS_ Modules was a perfect combination for my purposes here. The project is small and I believe it's not difficult to navigate around, in any case there are 2 main folders _-pages-_ and _-components-_ which are pretty much self-explanatory.  
- _NOTE:_ The game is not fully responsive since I put more emphasis on design & game functionality and I didn't want to waste much time to perfectly fit all devices.
