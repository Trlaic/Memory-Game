# Horror Memory Game
***
## Technical description  
Project is done with **Vite** as a development environment tool. I've decided to use it instead of **Webpack** (which I had been using in my previous React based projects), even though in small project like this I think it would make no difference in terms of speed.  
_React + TypeScript + SCSS_ Modules was a perfect combination for my purposes here. The project is small and I believe it's not difficult to navigate around, in any case there are 2 main folders _-pages-_ and _-components-_ which are pretty much self=explanatory.  
_NOTE:_ The game is not fully responsive since I put more emphasis on design & game functionality and I didn't want to waste much time to perfectly fit all devices.

## Game description  
It's a small game, but I made it purposefully to not be as straightforward as it probably should be (it's a freaking memory game, what are you doing man).  
**Functionalities**:  
- Press 'F' key to enter/exit fullscreen
- Press _note_ icon in upper right corner to play/stop song (there are 3 songs which are played randomly)
